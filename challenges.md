-> Shell Programming Challenges
===============================

1. Write a shell script to tell whether a numebr is prime. Either print out
  "prime"/"composite" or exit with success/failure status.

2. Write a script which can find the number of occurances of a pattern in a
  file / set of files.

3. Write a script that can do a recursive rename. I.e. it should take an original
  name and new name and rename all files found with that name.
