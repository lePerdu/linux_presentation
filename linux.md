-> What is Linux, really?
=========================

From kernel.org:
> Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from
> scratch by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit
> team of hackers across the Net.

^
> 10/10!
^
>
> A free and open source, highly-configurable,
> developer-oriented operating system.
